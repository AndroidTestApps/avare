<h3 style="text-align: center;">Warning!<br>
</h3>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hand held GPS applications on smart devices are not
approved by the FAA for IFR flights. Operating systems on smart
devices are not tested according to the strict FAA standards, and
hence any software running on them is unfit for use as a primary
flight navigation tool. It is unwise to completely rely on a smart device GPS
application during the critical phases of a flight.</span><br>
<br>
Please
do not download any charts/plates that you do not need for navigation.
Downloading only the needed files will help us keep server hosting
costs down, allowing for the application to be free to all. Thank you.<br>

Below is a list of your options for Avare (pronounced "Av Air") Help. Note that those at the top of the list are available <strong>Offline</strong>
(without internet access on your device), such as when you are flying
or your device is in Airplane Mode. The final two options on the list
below will use your browser to display internet video demos and our
website for any Help updates or News (these options require that your
device be Online).

</h3><p>&#8226;When you first launch Avare, after reading the disclaimer just
click OK. Before using other features in Avare, you'll want to use it
via an internet connection on your device (WiFi or Data) to Download
the free Database, airport diagrams, terminal procedures, charts and other files you'll
want. Press the Options key (button on the lower left side of the
screen), select one or more download items from the list, then the
Start button to begin downloading. When you're done Downloading, just
hit
the Back key on your device to see the charts. After doing this, no data
connection is required to use the materials you've downloaded with
Avare.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: Some times after Avare upgrade, on
new install, you will be taken to Download screen automatically.&nbsp;
Press the Map key on that screen to get to the main screen.<br>
</p>



<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: If you forgot to ensure that GPS
is on in your device's Settings, Avare will remind you to do that
because it is unable to display your position accurately without GPS.
To possibly speed up internal GPS acquisition, you can ensure that all
services (WiFi, cell service, and data) are at least temporarily turned
on too.</p>
<p>&#8226;<strong>Move around</strong> or change zoom on the Sectionals
simply by holding a point on the chart and dragging or two finger
pinching, just like when viewing photos on your device.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: Either the default horizontal
Landscape or vertical Portrait mode display with North Up (not Track
Up) is currently available, selected in Preferences.</p>
<p>&#8226;<strong>Double tap</strong> the screen to center the location
pointer and resume tracking your current GPS location (if available) on
the "moving map" chart.</p>
<p>&#8226;<strong>Long-press</strong> any point on the chart (with GPS
acquired) to display text at the top-right of the screen giving
approximate compass direction and distance <strong>From</strong>, followed by bearing <strong>To</strong>, that point in relation to your GPS location. Very handy when contacting ATC or making CTAF calls!</p>
<p>&#8226;For <strong>METAR/TAF weather</strong>, long-press any airport
symbol on the chart (with internet connection) to display METAR/TAF
text for that airport.&nbsp; METAR/TAF are updated every half hour when
Internet connection is available.<br>
</p>
<p>&#8226;<strong>Press the Options key</strong>, and a Menu of buttons for more features and Preferences is displayed across the screen.</p>

<p>&#8226;The "<strong>Search</strong>" button in the bottom menu activates a search box for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3-digit</span> Destination
Airport code (and Navaid code, and Fix code) that Avare uses to display a course, bearing,
etc. This code also determines which airport Avare uses when you
display A/FD info.&nbsp; If you do not remember the airport code for an
airport, enter part of its facility name to search for it.<br>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>To input a Destination airport</strong>, just tap the Search in the Menu and then input the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>three</strong></span> digit airport code (example: LAX, <em>not</em> KLAX).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note that a selection list of any similar previously input Destination codes is displayed before you begin to input a new one.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>METAR/TAF conditions</strong>
may be indicated for each airport in the list. To use this feature,
ensure that your device has active internet access (WiFi or Data). Note that if GPS is off, Nearest will assume your most recent
location. Cloud/visibility conditions for each airport is indicated by dots using
the FAA standard: Green = VFR; Blue = Minimum VFR; Red = IFR; Magenta =
Minimum IFR.</p>
<p>&#8226;The "<strong>Download</strong>" button in the Menu displays a list
of charts currently available online for your version of Avare. Just
click a chart name to install it. Note that new charts and features are
being added frequently, so check often to ensure that you have the
latest Avare version and Downloads.</p>
<p>&#8226;The <strong>"?" Help</strong> button in the Menu activates a web
browser app to display this Avare in-app Help with a link to the Extra
Info online at our apps4av website.</p>
<p>&#8226;The "<strong>Preferences</strong>" button in the Menu displays a list where you can choose among available Preferences (details below).</p>
<p><strong>&#8226;To browse charts</strong> freely without reference to your GPS location, press the Options key, tap the Preferences button, and select <strong>Simulation Mode</strong> (SM). Then quickly zip to any location simply by inputting a Destination as described above.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Notes: SM works without any need for
cell or data access or GPS. If GPS is on and has acquired a "lock" on
your location, it will retain lock in SM while Avare is active and the
device is on. This is helpful because once internal GPS is lost, many
devices won't re-acquire without a cell or WiFi signal which can happen
when aloft in many areas. In SM, Destination will center the chart
display at the airport code you input, and you can then browse from
there or input another airport code. When you use Preferences to turn
SM off again, the display will return to your current GPS location if
available.</p><strong>&#8226;To track a course to destination</strong>
enter a destination, and a magneta greater circle route will appear
from the current location to that destination. The magenta route line
will not move with the aircraft movement. A hatched black and white
line will show the current bearing to the destination. A red dashed
line will extend the aircraft nose. To fly the shortest course to the
destination with zero wind, a user may fly so that the black and white
line aligns with the red line.

<p><b><i>Additional Screens</i></b><br>
Beginning in Avare version 3.2 you can view these other screens in
addition to the Map screen, using Tabs along the bottom of the display.</p>
<p>&#8226;The "<strong>Search</strong>" Tab at the bottom of the screen allows the user to search for a way point / destination.<br>
 </p>
<p>&#8226;The "<strong>Plates</strong>" Tab at the bottom of the screen
displays the FAA airport diagrams, and terminal procedures for the currently selected Destination
airport.<br>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>To view an airport diagram</strong>
first input a Destination airport code in Map view as described above,
then tap the "Plates" Tab then select "AIRPORT-DIAGRAM" from the drop down list, and Avare will display it, if you have used
Download to install the Plates file for your location, and a diagram is
available for your current Destination airport. Note that "<b>GPS Taxi</b>" was added in Avare version 3.2, to show your current location on an
airport (see the link for details at the top of this page, or scroll
down to that section below).
</p><p>&#8226;The "<strong>A/FD</strong>" Tab at the bottom of the screen displays the airport info for the currently selected Destination airport.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>To get airport info (A/FD)</strong>,
first input a Destination airport in Map view as described above, then
tap the "A/FD" Tab and scroll through the info. The drop down A/FD bar
on the top is used to select between the text and the graphical A/FD.
The graphical A/FD direcotry can be downloaded from the download menu from the group "A/FD Images".<br>
</p>
<p>&#8226;Use the <strong>Nearest</strong> button in the Menu to display a selectable list nearest airports from your current GPS location.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To use the Nearest feature, first ensure
that GPS is on and has acquired your location, then press the Nearest
Tab at the bottom of the screen. The airports are listed by increasing
distance with nearest at the top. Each airport's name, code, distance,
bearing, and 100LL fuel (if available) is displayed (Jet A may be shown
as "A" alone, or as 100LLA indicating availability of both fuels). The
current weather for each airport may also be indicated using FAA color
codes: VFR=Green, White or no color; MVFR=Blue; IFR=Red; MIFR-Magenta.
</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note: To select an airport on the list as Avare's current <strong>Destination</strong>, simply press the name of that airport, then click the animated button to set it as destination.</p>

<hr size="1">
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="Help">Help</a> - Offline Extra Info</h3>
<p>&#8226;<strong>Text information</strong> is displayed around the margins
of the Map display screen, when your GPS position is acquired and you
have input a valid Destination. The GPS speed is displayed at the
top-left, second row. Destination:Distance from GPS location, time to
Destination
direct at current GPS speed, and GPS bearing to Destination is
displayed at the top-right, first row. GPS Heading of flight course is
displayed top-right, second row.<br>
</p>
<p>&#8226;A line originating at the <strong>Current GPS Location</strong> (jet aircraft) icon indicates the current heading.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Note that the orientation of the "jet
aircraft" Location icon rotates to indicate your approximate TRUE Heading
track of flight. As with many GPS apps, the icon's angle may be used as
a pointer to roughly follow your Course To Destination indicator line.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To temporarily <strong style="font-weight: normal;">hide the Course</strong>
To Destination line, long-press (press and hold) any point on the
screen. You can move the Map around by dragging it while keeping your
finger in contact with the screen.</p>
<p>&#8226;<strong>GPS Status</strong> information is available from the Map
screen by pressing the Options key and tapping the "GPS" button so that
a black "target" screen appears. This feature is helpful in positioning
your device for best reception using an internal GPS, and in
troubleshooting internal GPS problems. At the top-left is the number of
satellites acquired. The current Lat/Long locations, and an estimate of
the location accuracy are also displayed. The target display simulates
the strength and relative locations of satellites acquired. To close
the GPS screen and return to the Map display press the Back key.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Depending on your device and Android version, in the black <strong>notification bar</strong>
at the top of the screen there might be a round GPS indicator that
flashes occasionally to indicate GPS polling, and a small airplane icon
may indicate when the device is in Airplane Mode (cell and data turned
off, providing location using only the internal GPS if equipped).</p>
<p>&#8226;<strong>METAR/TAF weather</strong> information can be fetched by Avare
via the internet, when a connection is available. To get Avare's most
recent METAR/TAF report for any airport, just long-press that airport on
the chart and continue pressing for a moment while the information is
processed so that Avare can display it.</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If any of the text is obscured by your
hand, drag the chart to the side while keeping your finger on the
airport symbol. Once you've finished looking at the text, remove your
finger from the screen and it will disappear. Note that the From and To
details for that airport relative to your current GPS location will
also be displayed (at top-right) if your device has acquired a GPS
location.</p>
<p>&#8226;<strong>TFRs</strong> that Avare has recently fetched via internet
from the FAA are automatically displayed as red graphics on charts by
default. If you long-press the red indicator at the top-center of a TFR
shape, text for that TFR will be displayed at the upper-left of the
screen. It is user's responsibility to update the latest TFRs from the download list under the Databases group.<br>
</p>
<p>&#8226;<strong>Runway Extensions</strong> show 6 degree approach to all runways at a given airport set as Destination.<br>


</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="Terminal">Terminal Procedures, Graphical A/FD Pages<br>
</a></h3>


<p>&#8226;<strong>Plates</strong><br></p>
<p>The Plates screen shows the terminal procedure plates when
downloaded by the user.&nbsp; To see terminal procedures for an
airport, simply enter it as destination, then press the Plates screen
tab at the bottom of the screen. Select the appropriate procedure from
the drop down list for that airport. <br>
</p>
Plates are distributed in several files, one for each state.&nbsp;
There are tens of thousands of proceudres, making plate files large.
For example, the Texas plates download size is about 300 MB.<br>
<br>
The plates screen also displays graphical A/FD (the green book) when
downloaded. A/FD pages appear in the end of the drop down list, and are
named according to the page number of an A/FD directory for that
particular region. Note that textual A/FD does not require downloading
the graphical A/FD.<br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="Diags">Airport Diagrams</a> - Intro</h3>

<p>&#8226;<strong>"GPS Taxi"</strong><br>
GPS taxi position was added to Avare in version 3.2, displaying an airplane
icon at your current GPS location on the FAA Airport Diagram for your
currently selected Destination airport.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong></strong>GPS Taxi on airport diagrams is <b>not "moving map"</b>
so your location will not be automatically tracked at the center of the
screen, but instead you must scroll the Diagram to find the airplane
icon that indicates your position. </p>You will be able to scroll
the Plates screen while on the airport with GPS On to find the
airplane icon at your current location and use the "GPS Taxi" feature
on that airport.<br>
<p>GPS Taxi is active when "AIRPORT-DIAGRAM" is selected in the Plates screen.<br>
</p>
<p><br>

<hr size="1">
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="Landmarks">Fly To Landmarks</a>/Addresses - Intro</h3>


<p>&#8226;<strong>"Fly There"</strong></p>
<p>You
can directly enter addresses and landmarks like "Statue Of Liberty"
(without the quotes), or "800 Boylston St&nbsp;&nbsp;Boston, MA 02199"
(without the quotes) as destinations.&nbsp; You must be connected to the Internet
before entering a new address. Once Avare decodes the address, it
appears permanently under Avare's Destination search menu, and Internet
connection is not required to navigate to it.</p>

  
<ul>
<li>Go to Search screen, and enter an address or location like
"Tappan Zee Bridge" in the Search box, a pin icon appears in the list
of options.</li>
  <li>Touch the pin icon to navigate to Tappan Zee Bridge.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Fly There address feature also allows
you to feed addresses from the Google Maps application.&nbsp; Avare
will store the addresses in its recent destinations list, and can be
directed to draw track to them during flight.&nbsp; Although Internet
connection is required for the Google Maps application to locate an
address, and send it to Avare, it is not necessary once Avare decodes
the address, and stores it.&nbsp; Multiple addresses can be stored.<br>
</p>


<ul>
  <li>Simply start the Google maps application on your phone<br>
  </li>
  <li>Enter an address or location like "Tappan Zee Bridge"</li>
  <li>Google Maps will locate the bridge, and put a red marker icon on it.</li>
  <li>Long press the marker icon, and a pop up menu will show option "Share This Position"</li>
  <li>Press "Share This Position", then select Avare from list of applications</li>
  <li>Avare will use that address as destination</li>
  <li>During flight, "Tappan Zee Bridge" will be available in Avare under Search menu</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions, <em>and Answers</em></strong></span></p>

<p><a name="avareName"></a><em><strong>* Where did the Avare name come from?</strong></em><br>Avare
(pronounced "Av Air") is a contraction of the words Aviation
(Situational) Awareness. So you can use Avare to more conveniently be
Aware of FAA information in flight and for planning purposes.</p>

<p><a name="faaReq"></a><em><strong>* Does Avare meet FAA chart requirements?</strong></em><br></p>
<p>Avare delivers all data every 28 days as the FAA requires. There may
be a few days lag in uploading the
latest data due to limited resources on the Avare project, and it is
possible that some charts and plates may be expired by a few
days.&nbsp; However, plates and many charts have expiry date printed on
them by the FAA.<br>
</p>
<p>IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PILOT IN COMMAND TO VERIFY THAT ALL
TERMINAL PROCEDURES AND CHARTS ARE UP TO DATE BEFORE USING THEM.<br>
</p>
<p>THE FAA DOES NOT APPROVE USE OF HANDHELD GPS DEVICES FOR IFR FLIGHTS.<br>
</p>
<p>
Note that Avare is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong>
an FAA certified app, and is not intended for primary navigation or
information. <br>
</p><p>Charts and data must be up to date at all times.&nbsp; If any
item in the Download list in marked red, or has a red colored icon
associated with it, then that item has expired and a new version is
available on the server. <br>
</p>
<p>User may not comibe expired and current data, as it can cause GPS location issues, and chart overlapping.<br>
</p>


<p><a name="accuracy"></a><em><strong>* How accurate is Avare's indicated GPS position?</strong></em><br>Users
have reported Avare to be accurate to less than one hundred feet
with their device's internal GPS, and some have found it much more
accurate with an external WAAS GPS. We recommend using external
Bluetooth GPS with Avare because mobile devices internal GPS is almost
always never realibale enough for air navigation. External GPS for
Android start at $25 a piece.</p>
<p><a name="trackup"></a><em><strong>*</strong></em><em><strong> How can a user set track up mode?</strong></em><br>
The NU/TU button allows a user to set track up mode. In this mode, the
map roatates instead of the miniature aircraft. To get to truck up
mode, press the NU/TU button on the Maps screen so it shows "TU". The
miniature aircraft will align to the track of the aircraft being flown.
In this mode, panning and touch input is disabled, however, zooming and
double touch works as usual.
</p>


<p><a name="storage"></a> <em><strong>* Is there a fix for internal storage running low with Avare?</strong></em><br>
Avare has an option in Preferences, for selecting your storage location
for charts. It's possible that your device has free space on an SD card
or other storage medium. Note that you will need to re-Download (or
manually relocate) any previously Downloaded charts after changing the
storage location Preference.</p>


<p><a name="noIntGPS"></a> <em><strong>* Can I install Avare on devices w/o a GPS?</strong></em><br>
Yes, Avare has been successfully installed and used on every Android
device we have tested. Due to limitations imposed by the Google Play
store, if you can't install there you may want to try the Avare Alternate
Installation instructions on our <a href="http://avgps.wordpress.com/avare-overview/avare-manual-installation/">website</a>.</p>

<p><a name="noGplay"></a> <em><strong>* Where can I get Avare other than the Google Play store?</strong></em><br>
Avare is available on CNet, and a growing number of other sources.
Please use caution, because some non-Google sources may not be safe or
secure. You can install Avare directly from us using the Avare Alternate Installation instructions on our&nbsp;<a href="http://avgps.wordpress.com/avare-overview/avare-manual-installation/">website</a>.</p>

<p><a name="blackScr"></a> <em><strong>* Why do I only see a black screen and no chart?</strong></em><br>
When you first install Avare, no charts are included, and Sectionals is
set as the default chart display type. If you haven't downloaded a
chart yet, press your device's Options key then press Download and
choose the chart(s) you'll be using. If you haven't downloaded the
Sectional chart for your area, doing that will probably be helpful for
your future use of Avare. To view only charts other than Sectionals
(TACs for example), use Preferences and Select Chart Type.</p>

<p><a name="airpDiag"></a> <em><strong>* How do I display an Airport Diagram?</strong></em><br>To
view Airport Diagrams just input a Destination and then press the
Plates tab, then select "AIRPORT-DIAGRAM" from the drop down list. Note
that before you can view any airport diagram you must
Download the plates for that airport's state/territory via the Download
button.</p>


<p><a name="memSize"></a> <em><strong>* How much memory does Avare use?</strong></em><br>The
total installed size of Avare with the Database and A/FD is about 16MB.
The average chart is about 10 MB, and the total size of all sectionals,
WAC, TAC, and IFR charts is about 500 MB. Terminal procedures are about
3 GB. Note that Preferences

ensure that your device has an active Internet connection. Then simply
long-press on any airport on the chart. While you hold your finger on
the airport symbol, Avare will use the internet to obtain and process
the most recent available METAR for that airport. When it displays,
continue pressing until you have finished reading it.</p>
<p><a name="altitude"></a> <em><strong>* How do I get Altitude?</strong></em><br>The
current GPS altitude is not displayed on the map screen. GPS altitude
is not accurate, and is provided only for informational purposes under
the GPS screen.&nbsp; You can navigate to the GPS screen using the

Simulation Mode checkbox.</p>

<p><em><strong><a name="optKey"></a></strong></em><em><strong>* </strong></em><em><strong>Where's this "Option" key, mentioned in Help files for Avare?</strong></em><br>This is a button on the bottom left of the Map screen.</p>
<p><em><strong><a name="enterGPS"></a></strong></em><em><strong>* </strong></em><em><strong>How do I enter a GPS latitude/</strong></em><em><strong>longitude</strong></em><em><strong> location as Destination</strong></em><br>Press
the Search menu tab, then enter a
latitutde&amp;longitude (use negative sign for West) pair, for example
42.8933&amp;-74.4422 in the search box. Select it from the list as the
only found destination.<br>
</p>



<p><a name="airpMode"></a> <em><strong>* Does Avare work in Airplane Mode?</strong></em><br>
Yes, once you have used Download to install any charts (or the set of
Airport Diagrams) as desired, all features of Avare work just fine in
airplane mode on most devices. Note that some devices have difficulty
acquiring GPS "lock" without cell and/or data/wifi, but will work fine
in airplane mode once lock is acquired IF the device is kept awake and
you don't switch out of the Avare app.</p>

<p><a name="distTo"></a><em><strong>* How do I get distance &amp; heading TO any point on a chart?</strong></em><br>
Just long-press any point on the chart while your device has your GPS
location acquired. The course indicator line (if present) will be
hidden, and in the top-right corner of the screen you will see the
Compass Direction, Bearing, and Distance both TO and FROM your current
location. <em>This is handy for ATC and CTAF radio calls.</em> Note that if internet access is active, METAR/TAF text may also be displayed if you long-press on an airport.<br>
</p>

<p><a name="distFm"></a><em><strong>* How do I get distance &amp; heading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FROM</span> any point on a chart?</strong></em><br>
Just long-press any point on the chart while your device has your GPS
location acquired. The course indicator line (if present) will be
hidden, and in the top-right corner of the screen you will see the
Compass Direction, Bearing, and Distance both TO and FROM your current
location. <em>This is handy for ATC and CTAF radio calls.</em> Note that if internet access is active, METAR/TAF text may also be displayed if you long-press on an airport.</p>

<p><a name="txtItems"></a><em><strong>* What are each of the text items on screen for?</strong></em><br>
Top right is
Destination:Distance from your current GPS location, Hours:Minutes to
Destination if flying direct at the current GPS speed, and GPS bearing
to Destination. Second line has your current speed, and GPS Heading.</p><a name="afd"></a><em><strong>* How do I get all the available A/FD info for an airport?</strong></em><br>
<p>The airport information displayed by the A/FD tab is that of your
current Destination. Remember to scroll the list if that option is displayed, so
that you can see any additional screens of A/FD info. To see the A/FD
for a different airport, just change your Destination and then use the
A/FD tab again.</p>

<p><a name="afdSwitch"></a><em><strong>* How can I quickly switch between A/FDs for different airports?</strong></em><br>
The easiest method is to use the Nearest tab, since you can just
select from a list of the nearest airports. You can also use the
Destination button to change the airport code, and then use the A/FD tab to display it.<br>
</p>

<p><a name="mvChart"></a><em><strong>* How can I quickly move the Map display?</strong></em><br>Press
the Option key, then the Preferences button and then the
Enter Simulation Mode checkbox. Then you can use Destination to quickly
move around the chart or browse freely.</p>


<p><a name="exit"></a><em><strong>* How do I exit Avare to close or Restart it?</strong></em><br>
To completely Exit Avare use your device's Back key as required until
you leave Avare. Avare is designed to completely stop all operations
when you switch to another app or to the Home screen, so you can return
to it instantly later if you choose. The only time you need to Exit is
when Avare indicates that it's required.&nbsp; Note that the GPS will keep running up to two minutes after Avare exits.<br>
</p>

<p><a name="switchApp"></a><em><strong>* How do I switch from Avare to allow for a quick return later?</strong></em><br>
Simply push your device's Home key. Android also offers a feature to
switch between recent apps. Just long-press your Home key and Android
will present you with a selection of recent applications you can switch
to. Note that the internal GPS in some devices may lose GPS lock if
Avare is not the active app for more than a few minutes, so you'll want
to test your device for this in advance of flight.</p>

<p><a name="Tfr"></a><em><strong>* How do I get Avare to display FAA TFRs?</strong></em><br>The user can download the latest TFRs from the Download list under Databses. TFRs are automatically displayed on the chart
in red by default.
If you long-press the indicator at the top-center of a TFR shape, text
information (including date/time) for that TFR will be displayed at the
upper-left of the screen. Apps4av servers update TFRs every top of the hour.<br>
</p>

<p><a name="trackLine"></a><em><strong>* How do I use the Course line?</strong></em><br>
It is provided primarily for route planning, such as to avoid obstacles
or Restricted areas. It is also useful for visually aligning the
location icon "airplane" to the line as an approximate navigation aid.</p>


<p><a name="timeCalc"></a><em><strong>* How is the Time to Destination calculated?</strong></em><br>
It is a simple calculation of the time required at your current GPS
ground speed if you fly direct to the indicated bearing. It does not
allow for wind or ground course variations, but is continually updated
based on your current GPS position and ground speed.</p>

<p><a name="runway"></a><em><strong>* Where can I find runway or Comm airport info?</strong></em><br>
First be sure you have activated a Destination airport. Then press your
device's A/FD tab, then scroll through the
list to see the informaion available for that airport.</p>

<p><a name="hideTrack"></a><em><strong>* How can I temporarily hide the Course line?</strong></em><br>
Long-press any point on the chart display, and the course line will be hidden until you release your finger from the chart.</p>

<p><a name="trackOff"></a><em><strong>* How can I permanently remove the Course line?</strong></em><br>
Press the Options key, then press the Preferences button in
the Menu, then click the checkbox for Enter Simulation Mode. You'd of
course repeat this process to turn the line back on, and resume GPS
navigation. Another way to remove the Course line is to turn off GPS,
but the internal GPS on many devices might have difficulty re-acquiring
your location while in flight.</p>


<p><a name="battGPS"></a><em><strong>* Can battery level affect my device's internal GPS?</strong></em><br>
Yes. Users have reported that their GPS may not acquire as quickly or
reliably at low battery levels (below 30% or even higher on some
devices). Plugging your device into external power may help with your
device's internal GPS performance.</p>

<p><a name="dispLong"></a> <em><strong>* How can I get Destination charts to display longer?</strong></em><br>
When GPS is active, the chart display will briefly shift to your
Destination airport just after you input. You can switch to Simulation
Mode in Preferences (press Option key, Preferences button, then Enter
Simulation Mode). Simulation Mode will let you jump instantly to any
airport for both display and A/FD info for that airport, while
retaining GPS operation. To view or use your current location again,
just un-check the Simulation Mode checkbox.</p>

<p><a name="launchTime"></a> <em><strong>* How long does it take from Avare launch before I see charts?</strong></em><br>
The startup time depends mostly on your device, but usually a few
seconds up to a minute. Note that no charts or Airport Diagrams can be
displayed until you Download them. If you see a black screen, chances
are your GPS isn't working yet or you haven't downloaded the chart for
your area.</p>

<p><a name="noCell"></a> <em><strong>* Can I use Avare without cell or data service?</strong></em><br>
Yes, once you have used Download to install any charts (or the set of
Airport Diagrams) as desired, all features of Avare work just fine in
airplane mode on every Android device we've tested. Note that the
internal GPS on some devices may have difficulty acquiring "lock"
without cell and/or data/wifi, but will work fine in airplane mode once
lock is acquired IF the device is kept awake and you don't switch out
of the Avare app.</p>


<p><a name="dBase"></a> <em><strong>* What's in the Database file Avare uses?</strong></em><br>
The file named Database in the Downloads menu contains the current A/FD
(except for Airport Diagrams) and is also required for Avare to know
the name, boundaries and GPS calibration for each chart. Before you can
use any charts, Avare needs this information so that it can assemble
all the charts you've downloaded into a seamless mosaic. Avare then
calculates where to display your GPS location on that mosaic of
downloaded charts. Always be sure to Download the latest Database <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span>
you Download any new or updated charts. Note that if an item in the
Download list has a green checkmark at the left, it's downloaded, and latest.</p>

<p><a name="browse"></a> <em><strong>* How do I browse charts and then get back to current location?</strong></em><br>
You can browse charts by zooming and dragging them, and double-tap to
resume GPS moving map. To browse freely, use Simulation Mode, and then
turn off that mode to instantly return to your current location. In Map
view press Option key, the Preferences button, then
check-mark the Enter Simulation Mode line. To view or use your current
location again, just un-check the Enter Simulation Mode checkbox.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><a name="completeshutdown"></a> <em><strong>* What is a complete shutdown?</strong></em><br>By
default, Avare will keep a background process running. This process
will store important data like the current destination, the
location,&nbsp; the map view, the weather, the TFRs, and the airport
information.&nbsp; This process will wake up periodically for a few
simple tasks (fetch TFRs, weather etc.). It will also keep the GPS on
for up to 2 minutes after the user exits Avare.</p>
<p>The background process allows the user to temporarily switch to
other applications without losing the flight data, and the GPS lock.<br>
</p>
<p>The user can completely exit Avare, and stop the background process
by unselecting option "Leave Running" in the preferences menu item.<em></em>
