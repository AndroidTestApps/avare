<p>&#149;When you first launch Avare, after reading the disclaimer just click OK. Before using other features in Avare, you'll want to use it via an internet connection on your device (WiFi or Data) to Download the free Database, Airport Diagrams, charts and other files you'll want. Press the Options key on your device, then the Download button in the Menu to begin. Note that the full Menu with the Download button is only available in the <strong>Map</strong> view in Avare version 3.2. To activate the Download after making your selections, hit the Options key. When you're done Downloading, just hit the Back key on your device to browse charts. After doing this, no data connection is required to use the materials you've downloaded with Avare.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Note: If you forgot to ensure that GPS is on in your device's Settings, Avare will remind you to do that because it is unable to display your position accurately without GPS. To possibly speed up internal GPS acquisition, you can ensure that all services (WiFi, cell service, and data) are at least temporarily turned on too.</p>
<p>&#149;<strong>Move around</strong> or change zoom on the Sectionals simply by holding a point on the chart and dragging or two finger pinching, just like when viewing photos on your device.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Note: Either the default horizontal Landscape or vertical Portrait mode display with North Up (not Track Up) is currently available, selected in Preferences.</p>
<p>&#149;<strong>Double tap</strong> the screen to center the location pointer and resume tracking your current GPS location (if available) on the "moving map" chart.</p>
<p>&#149;<strong>Long-press</strong> any point on the chart (with GPS acquired) to display text at the top-right of the screen giving approximate compass direction and distance <strong>From</strong>, followed by bearing <strong>To</strong>, that point in relation to your GPS location. Very handy when contacting ATC or making CTAF calls!</p>
<p>&#149;For <strong>METAR weather</strong>, long-press any airport symbol on the chart (with internet connection) to display METAR text for that airport.</p>
<p>&#149;<strong>Press the Options key</strong> on your device, and a Menu of buttons for more features and Preferences is displayed across the bottom of the screen (press your device's Back key to exit the Menu when done).</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Note</strong> that the full Menu of Options is only available in the <strong>Map</strong> view in Avare version 3.2.</p>
<p>&#149;The "<strong>Destination</strong>" button in the Menu activates the input box for a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">3-digit</span> Destination Airport code that Avare uses to display a track, bearing, etc. This code also determines which airport Avare uses when you display A/FD info.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>To input a Destination airport</strong>, just push the Options key on your device, tap the Destination button (arrow icon) in the Menu and then input the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>three</strong></span> digit airport code (example: LAX, <em>not</em> KLAX).</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Note that a selection list of any similar previously input Destination codes is displayed as you begin to input a new one.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>METAR cloud conditions</strong> may be indicated for each airport in the list. To use this feature, ensure that your device has active internet access (WiFi or Data), and that in Preferences you have a green checkmark on "Enable TFRs and METARS" (Note that if GPS is off, Nearest will assume your most recent location). Cloud conditions for each airport is indicated by dots using the FAA standard: White = VFR; Blue = Minimum VFR; Red = IFR; Magenta = Minimum IFR.</p>
<p>&#149;The "<strong>Download</strong>" button in the Menu displays a list of charts currently available online for your version of Avare. Just click a chart name to install it. Note that new charts and features are being added frequently, so check often to ensure that you have the latest Avare version and Downloads.</p>
<p>&#149;The <strong>"?" Help</strong> button in the Menu activates a web browser app to display this Avare in-app Help with a link to the Extra Info online at our apps4av website.</p>
<p>&#149;The "<strong>Preferences</strong>" button in the Menu displays a list where you can set your Base airport code and choose among available Preferences (details below).</p>
<p><strong>&#149;To browse charts</strong> freely without reference to your GPS location, press the Options key on your device, tap the Preferences button, and select <strong>Simulation Mode</strong> (SM). Then quickly zip to any location simply by inputting a Destination as described above.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Notes: SM works without any need for cell or data access or GPS. If GPS is on and has acquired a "lock" on your location, it will retain lock in SM while Avare is active and the device is on. This is helpful because once internal GPS is lost, many devices won't re-acquire without a cell or WiFi signal which can happen when aloft in many areas. In SM, Destination will center the chart display at the airport code you input, and you can then browse from there or input another airport code. When you use Preferences to turn SM off again, the display will return to your current GPS location if available.</p>

<P><B><I>Additional Screens</i></b><BR />
Beginning in Avare version 3.2 you can view these other screens in addition to the Map screen, using Tabs along the bottom of the display.</p>
<p>&#149;The "<strong>Diagram</strong>" Tab at the bottom of the screen displays the FAA Airport Diagram for the currently selected Destination airport.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>To view an Airport Diagram</strong> first input a Destination airport code in Map view as described above, then tap the "Diagram" Tab and Avare will display it, if you have used Download to install the Airport Diagrams file and a diagram is available for your current Destination airport. Note that "<B>Live Taxi</b>" GPS was added in Avare version 3.2, to show your current location on an airport (see the link for details at the top of this page, or scroll down to that section below).
<p>&#149;The "<strong>A/FD</strong>" Tab at the bottom of the screen displays the airport info for the currently selected Destination airport.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>To get airport info (A/FD)</strong>, first input a Destination airport in Map view as described above, then tap the "A/FD" Tab and scroll through the info.</p>
<p>&#149;Use the <strong>Nearest</strong> button in the Menu to display a selectable list of the 50 nearest airports from your current GPS location.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">To use the Nearest feature, first ensure that GPS is on and has acquired your location, then press the Nearest Tab at the bottom of the screen. The airports are listed by increasing distance with nearest at the top. Each airport's name, code, distance, bearing, and 100LL fuel (if available) is displayed (Jet A may be shown as "A" alone, or as 100LLA indicating availability of both fuels). The current weather for each airport may also be indicated using FAA color codes: VFR=Green, White or no color; MVFR=Blue; IFR=Red; MIFR-Magenta.
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Note: To select an airport on the list as Avare's current <strong>Destination</strong>, simply press the name of that airport.</p>

<hr size="1" />
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="Help">Help</a> - Offline Extra Info</h3>
<p>&#149;<strong>Text information</strong> is displayed around the margins of the Map display screen, when your GPS position is acquired and you have input a valid Destination. The  GPS speed is displayed at the top-left. Destination:Distance from GPS location, time to Destination direct at current GPS speed, and GPS bearing to Destination is displayed at the top-right. GPS Heading of flight track is displayed bottom-right.  GPS altitude is displayed at the bottom-left.</p>
<p>&#149;A line originating at the <strong>Current GPS Location</strong> (jet aircraft) icon indicates the direct <strong>Track To Destination</strong> from your current location.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Note that the orientation of the "jet aircraft" Location icon rotates to indicate your approximate Heading track of flight. As with many GPS apps, the icon's angle may be used as a pointer to roughly follow your Track To Destination indicator line.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">To temporarily <strong>hide the Track</strong> To Destination line, long-press (press and hold) any point on the screen. You can move the Map around by dragging it while keeping your finger in contact with the screen.</p>
<p>&#149;<strong>GPS Status</strong> information is available from the Map screen by pressing the Options key and tapping the "GPS" button so that a black "target" screen appears. This feature is helpful in positioning your device for best reception using an internal GPS, and in troubleshooting internal GPS problems. At the top-left is the number of satellites acquired. The current Lat/Long locations, and an estimate of the location accuracy are also displayed. The target display simulates the strength and relative locations of satellites acquired.  To close the GPS screen and return to the Map display press the Back key.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Depending on your device and Android version, in the black <strong>notification bar</strong> at the top of the screen there might be a round GPS indicator that flashes occasionally to indicate GPS polling, and a small airplane icon may indicate when the device is in Airplane Mode (cell and data turned off, providing location using only the internal GPS if equipped).</p>
<p>&#149;<strong>METAR weather</strong> information can be fetched by Avare via the internet, when a connection is available. To get Avare's most recent METAR report for any airport, just long-press that airport on the chart and continue pressing for a moment while the information is processed so that Avare can display it.</p> 
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If any of the text is obscured by your hand, drag the chart to the side while keeping your finger on the airport symbol. Once you've finished looking at the text, remove your finger from the screen and it will disappear. Note that the From and To details for that airport relative to your current GPS location will also be displayed (at top-right) if your device has acquired a GPS location.</p>
<p>&#149;<strong>TFRs</strong> that Avare has recently fetched via internet from the FAA are automatically displayed as red graphics on charts by default. If you long-press the red indicator at the top-center of a TFR shape, text for that TFR will be displayed at the upper-left of the screen. When internet access is available Avare automatically searches for all TFRs hourly, but will try every minute if unable to find them due to lack of internet access or for any other reason.</p>
<p>&#149;To use the <strong>Base</strong> feature in the Map view, first press the Options key and then the Preferences button in the Menu and input a "Base" airport code. Note that this code can be changed any time you like, and doing so multiple times during a flight may be helpful. The main purpose of the Base feature is to allow quickly getting information for an airport other than the Destination airport.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If you have been flying a track to a Destination and you'd like the ability to shift Avare's focus instantly to your airport of origin, you'd have previously input that "Base" airport code in Preferences/Base. When ready to return you'd press your device's Options key and then the Destination button. The airport code you previously input as your Base in Preferences will appear as the default Destination code. Simply press OK in the "Enter Destination Code" box, and your Base will become the current Destination.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">So for short round-trip flights, you might just use Destination outbound and Base for return in this way. For longer multi-leg flights you could begin with Destination and then switch to using the Base feature, inputting a new Base code in Preferences for each leg. Note that Avare does not yet support VORs in Destination or Base.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Note that the Base, Nearest and previous Destination airport codes you have input are retained when you exit Avare (even via Force Close if you don't Clear Data), in case you'd like to use the same one again without need to input the entire code again for each flight. Just input the first letter in Destination and choose from your previously used airport codes displayed below. If you don't see the code you want in the list, either scroll the list or input the next letter.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="Diags">Airport Diagrams</a> - Intro</h3>
<p>&#149;<strong>"Live Taxi"</strong> GPS position was added to Avare in version 3.2, displaying an airplane icon at your current GPS location on the FAA Airport Diagram for your currently selected Destination airport. Note that your Android device may provide the ability to switch between Avare and your Web Browser that is displaying this Help file, by long-pressing the Home key.<BR />
<strong>A Demo Video</strong> of GeoTagging an Airport Diagram is available online (see link at the top of this page).</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Notes:</strong>Using any Airport Diagrams requires that you first Download the new version of the file that contains the complete set (see Download near the end of the Quick Start section above). Unlike simply viewing Airport Diagrams, using this "Live Taxi" feature <strong>requires GeoTag data</strong> and GPS. Live Taxi on Diagrams is <b>not "moving map"</b> so your location will not be automatically tracked at the center of the screen, but instead you must scroll the Diagram to find the airplane icon that indicates your position. Each airport must have GeoTag data for Live Taxi, and this section describes the process of calibrating an Airport Diagram to manually add that data using Avare's built-in GeoTag tool. Even without GeoTag data, all Airport Diagrams will display as they did in previous Avare versions but without the Live Taxi feature.</p>
<OL><strong><U>To GeoTag an Airport Diagram for Live Taxi:</u></strong>
<LI><I>Ensure that you have the current Airport Diagrams file (see Download).</li>
<LI>Ensure that you have input a Destination airport code.</i></li>
<LI>Tap the "Diagram" tab to display the Airport Diagram.</li>
<LI>At the center of the Diagram screen you will see red cross-hairs. Position the Diagram so that the cross-hairs are at an intersection of two Latitude/Longitude lines and both coordinate values are visible.<BR />
For example: on the BOS (Boston) Diagram, at the bottom-right you will find the intersection of 71&deg;00'W and 42&deg;21'N vertical and horizontal coordinate lines with both numbers nearby. You may need to zoom out using the "pinch" gesture to locate an intersection of coordinates where both values are visible, and zoom back in for optimal accuracy positioning the cross-hairs exactly at the coordinates intersection before you GeoTag the intersection.<BR /></li>
<LI>Note the values of the two coordinates at the intersection you have selected on the Diagram. In this example: 71&deg;00'W and 42&deg;21'N.</li>
<LI>Press the Options key on your device, and tap the GeoTag button.</li>
<LI>Tap the first value that needs to be changed from the approximate value provided to the value corresponding to the intersection you have chosen. In this example, "00.4" needs to be changed to 00 so that it matches 71&deg;00'W.</li>
<LI>Continue correcting the default values using the input screen until you are Done and then tap the "OK" button. If you make an error so that the final values displayed don't match those for the coordinates intersection, simply tap the "Cancel" button on the "Geo Tag this point" dialog and start over.</li>
<LI>Back at the Diagram screen, determine the values for a second intersection where both values are visible. Note that Avare requires the intersection be changed both vertically and horizontally, as indicated by the "drag line" line color changing from red to green when the cross-hairs are displaced enough for an accurate calibration. In this BOS Airport Diagram example, the only other value provided by the FAA for the vertical coordinate lines is 71&deg;01'W, so we will place the cross-hairs over the intersection of 71&deg;01'W and 42&deg;22'N.</li>
<LI>Press the Options key and GeoTag button to repeat the process of correcting the displayed values for the currently chosen coordinates intersection where the cross-hairs are positioned (71&deg;01'W and 42&deg;22'N in this example).</li>
<LI>If successful, the GeoTag calibration data for that airport will be saved, "Plate marked and saved" will be displayed, and the current Lat/Long coordinates of the red cross-hairs will be displayed in red text at the bottom-left as you move the Diagram. If not, repeat the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've GeoTagged an airport you will be able to scroll the Diagram screen while on the airport with GPS On to find the airplane icon at your current location and use the "Live Taxi" feature on that airport. Note that this feature is not "moving map" so if you double-tap the Diagram with GPS Off, Avare will place the cross-hairs at the default airport location value somewhere near the center of the airport. A non-GeoTagged airport Diagram will not display the airplane location icon, and the red text coordinates at the position of the red cross-hairs will <B><U>not</u></b> be displayed at the bottom-left. Red coordinates at the bottom-left of any Airport Diagram screen indicates that the currenlty displayed airport has been GeoTagged.</p>
<p>While the GeoTag process may seem very tedious and complicated when reading about it, if you GeoTag the BOS airport following these directions it will be easier to learn. Once you've done an airport or two, the process takes less than a minute. For convenience you'll want to GeoTag in advance, every airport on which you'd like to use the Live Taxi feature of Avare. We hope at some point to acquire free geotag data for FAA Airport Diagrams for inclusion in Avare, but until then this manual process will enable us to keep offering Avare as a free app while adding great new features like Live Taxi.<BR />
<strong>Note:</strong> You may find it easier to learn the GeoTag procedure by watching a video demo (see the link at the top of this page).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions, <em>and Answers</em></strong></span></p>

<p><a name="avareName"></a><em><strong>* Where did the Avare name come from?</strong></em><br />
Avare (pronounced "Av Air") is a contraction of the words Aviation (Situational) Awareness. So you can use Avare to more conveniently be Aware of FAA information in flight and for planning purposes.</p>

<p><a name="faaReq"></a><em><strong>* Does Avare meet FAA chart requirements?</strong></em><br />
Note that Avare is <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span></strong> an FAA certified app, and is not intended for primary navigation or information. But J. Mac McClellan, former editor-in-chief of "<em>FLYING</em>" magazine and popular columnist for EAA's "<em>Sport Aviation</em>" magazine wrote on 9/26/2012:</p>
<blockquote><p>"&#8230;the FARs are totally silent on any requirement for charts of any kind if you fly for personal reasons in an airplane that is not a turbojet, or not certified for takeoff above 12,500 pounds."</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that current TAC charts <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>are</strong></span> required for flying in some Class B special VFR corridors, and TAC charts were added to Avare with version 2.7 as more free chart Download options.</p>

<p><a name="accuracy"></a><em><strong>* How accurate is Avare's indicated GPS position?</strong></em><br />
Users have reported Avare to be accurate to less than one hundred feet with their device's internal GPS, and some have found it much more accurate with an external WAAS GPS.</p>

<p><a name="storage"></a> <em><strong>* Is there a fix for internal storage running low with Avare?</strong></em><br />
Avare has an option in Preferences, for selecting your storage location for charts. It's possible that your device has free space on an SD card or other storage medium. Note that you will need to re-Download (or manually relocate) any previously Downloaded charts after changing the storage location Preference.</p><BR />


<p><a name="noIntGPS"></a> <em><strong>* Can I install Avare on devices w/o a GPS?</strong></em><br />
Yes, Avare has been successfully installed and used on every Android device we have tested. Due to limitations imposed by the Google Play store, if you can't install there you may want to try the Avare Manual Installation instructions on our <a href="http://apps4av.com/avare-overview/avare-manual-installation/">http://apps4av.com/</a> website.</p>

<p><a name="noGplay"></a> <em><strong>* Where can I get Avare other than the Google Play store?</strong></em><br />
Avare is available on CNet, and a growing number of other sources. Please use caution, because some non-Google sources may not be safe or secure. You can manually install Avare directly from us using the Avare Manual Installation instructions on our http://apps4av.com/ website.</p>

<p><a name="blackScr"></a> <em><strong>* Why do I only see a black screen and no chart?</a></strong></em><br />
When you first install Avare, no charts are included, BOS is set as the default Base airport, and Sectionals is set as the default chart display type. If you haven't downloaded a chart yet, press your device's Options key then press Download and choose the chart(s) you'll be using. If you haven't downloaded the Sectional chart for your area, doing that will probably be helpful for your future use of Avare. To view only charts other than Sectionals (TACs for example), use Preferences and Select Chart Type. You may also want to set your Base airport code to replace BOS in Preferences.</p>

<p><a name="airpDiag"></a> <em><strong>* How do I display an Airport Diagram?</strong></em><br />
To view Airport Diagrams just input a Destination and then press the A/FD button, then select Airport Diagram from the list of info for that airport. Note that before you can view any Airport Diagram you must Download the entire set via the Download button.</p><BR />


<p><a name="memSize"></a> <em><strong>* How much memory does Avare use?</strong></em><br />The total installed size of Avare with the Database and A/FD is about 16.5MB. The average chart is about 10 MB, and the total size of all Sectional & TAC charts is about 400 MB. The file containing all available Airport Diagrams is about 90MB. For the typical pilot, Avare uses 1/10 the memory of comparable aviation chart apps. Note that Preferences includes an option for moving Avare files to different storage locations.</p>

<p><a name="wxMetar"></a> <em><strong>* How do I get METAR Weather?</strong></em><br />
First, ensure that your device has an active Internet connection. Then simply long-press on any airport on the chart. While you hold your finger on the airport symbol, Avare will use the internet to obtain and process the most recent available METAR for that airport. When it displays, continue pressing until you have finished reading it.</p>

<p><a name="mmapOff"></a> <em><strong>* Can I disable moving map while retaining GPS lock?</strong></em><br />
Just switch to Simulation Mode in Preferences (press Option key, Preferences button, then Enter Simulation Mode). Simulation Mode will let you use Destination to jump instantly to any airport for both display and A/FD info for that airport, while retaining GPS operation. To view or use your current location again, just un-check the Enter Simulation Mode checkbox.</p>

<p><em><strong>* <a name="optKey"></a>Where's this "Option" key, mentioned in Help files for Avare?</strong></em><br />
Android devices may have a hardware Option (aka Menu) key next to Home, Back, and Search keys, but many new devices don't. If your device doesn't have such a key, Android provides a "soft" button. On some devices it might be a three-dotted button that appears in a corner when you touch the screen. Other devices might have a key that you need to long-press, to pop up an Options menu. Once you find it, you'll want to try this Option feature on all your other apps because it sometimes adds cool features you may not have known about. Future versions of Avare may stop using the Options key, replacing it with other input options.</p><BR />


<p><a name="airpMode"></a> <em><strong>* Does Avare work in Airplane Mode?</strong></em><br />
Yes, once you have used Download to install any charts (or the set of Airport Diagrams) as desired, all features of Avare work just fine in airplane mode on most devices. Note that some devices have difficulty acquiring GPS "lock" without cell and/or data/wifi, but will work fine in airplane mode once lock is acquired IF the device is kept awake and you don't switch out of the Avare app.</p>

<p><a name="distTo"></a><em><strong>* How do I get distance &amp; heading TO any point on a chart?</strong></em><br />
Just long-press any point on the chart while your device has your GPS location acquired.  The track indicator line (if present) will be hidden, and in the top-right corner of the screen you will see the Compass Direction, Bearing, and Distance both TO and FROM your current location. <em>This is handy for ATC and CTAF radio calls.</em> Note that if internet access is active, METAR text may also be displayed if you long-press on an airport.</p>

<p><a name="distFm"></a><em><strong>* How do I get distance &amp; heading <span style="text-decoration:underline;">FROM</span> any point on a chart?</strong></em><br />
Just long-press any point on the chart while your device has your GPS location acquired.  The track indicator line (if present) will be hidden, and in the top-right corner of the screen you will see the Compass Direction, Bearing, and Distance both TO and FROM your current location. <em>This is handy for ATC and CTAF radio calls.</em> Note that if internet access is active, METAR text may also be displayed if you long-press on an airport.</p>

<p><a name="txtItems"></a><em><strong>* What are each of the text items on screen for?</strong></em><br />
Clockwise from top left is your current GPS speed. Top right is Destination:Distance from your current GPS location, Hours:Minutes to Destination if flying direct at the current GPS speed, and GPS bearing to Destination. Bottom right is your current GPS Heading track. Bottom left is your current GPS Altitude.</p><BR />


<p><a name="baseDest"></a><em><strong>* What's the difference between Base and Destination?</strong></em><br />
Base is simply an airport code that you store in Preferences so that it's easy to switch to as your Destination. You use the Destination button to input any airport code you choose. The airport code you have stored in Preferences for your Base will be displayed as the default when you press the Destination button. To activate the Base airport you have stored in Preferences just press your device's Option key, the Destination button, and the OK button. To select a Destination airport other than the Base, you just input the code you want in the Enter Destination Code dialog box, replacing your stored Base airport code that is automatically displayed there. Note that the Base code you store in Preferences can be changed as often as you like.</p>

<p><a name="afd"></a><em><strong>* How do I get all the available A/FD info for an airport?</strong></em><br />
The airport information displayed by the A/FD button is that of your current Destination. Press your device's Option key, then the A/FD button. Remember to scroll the list if that option is displayed, so that you can see any additional screens of A/FD info. To see the A/FD for a different airport, just change your Destination and then use the A/FD button again.</p>

<p><a name="afdSwitch"></a><em><strong>* How can I quickly switch between A/FDs for different airports?</strong></em><br />
The easiest method is to use the Nearest button, since you can just select from a list of the 50 nearest airports. You can also use the Destination button to change the airport code, and then use the A/FD button to display it. Another method is to switch between the Base airport you have stored in Preferences, view the A/FD, and then input a different Destination to view that A/FD. Note that the Base code you store in Preferences can be changed as often as you like.</p>

<p><a name="mvChart"></a><em><strong>* How can I quickly move the Map display?</strong></em><br />
Press the Option key on your device, then the Preferences button and then the Enter Simulation Mode checkbox. Then you can use Destination and/or Base to quickly move around the chart or browse freely.</p><BR />


<p><a name="exit"></a><em><strong>* How do I exit Avare to close or Restart it?</strong></em><br />
To completely Exit Avare use your device's Back key as required until you leave Avare. Avare is designed to completely stop all operations when you switch to another app or to the Home screen, so you can return to it instantly later if you choose. The only time you need to Exit is when Avare indicates that it's required.</p>

<p><a name="switchApp"></a><em><strong>* How do I switch from Avare to allow for a quick return later?</strong></em><br />
Simply push your device's Home key. Android also offers a feature to switch between recent apps. Just long-press your Home key and Android will present you with a selection of recent applications you can switch to.  Note that the internal GPS in some devices may lose GPS lock if Avare is not the active app for more than a few seconds, so you'll want to test your device for this in advance of flight.</p>

<p><a name="Tfr"></a><em><strong>* How do I get Avare to display FAA TFRs?</strong></em><br />
Avare automatically fetches all FAA TFRs hourly when there is internet access available (see your Preferences for other available options). If internet access is not available or there is some other problem such as an outage on the FAA server, Avare will try every minute and then revert to hourly again. TFRs are automatically displayed on the chart in red by default (see your Preferences for other available options). If you long-press the indicator at the top-center of a TFR shape, text information (including date/time) for that TFR will be displayed at the upper-left of the screen.</p>

<p><a name="trackLine"></a><em><strong>* How do I use the Track line?</strong></em><br />
It is provided primarily for route planning, such as to avoid obstacles or Restricted areas. It is also useful for visually aligning the location icon "airplane" to the line as an approximate navigation aid.</p><BR />


<p><a name="timeCalc"></a><em><strong>* How is the Time to Destination calculated?</strong></em><br />
It is a simple calculation of the time required at your current GPS ground speed if you fly direct to the indicated bearing. It does not allow for wind or ground track variations, but is continually updated based on your current GPS position and ground speed.</p>

<p><a name="runway"></a><em><strong>* Where can I find runway or Comm airport info?</strong></em><br />
First be sure you have activated a Destination or Base airport. Then press your device's Option key and then the A/FD button, then scroll through the list to see the informaion available for that airport.</p>

<p><a name="hideTrack"></a><em><strong>* How can I temporarily hide the Track line?</strong></em><br />
Long-press any point on the chart display, and the track line will be hidden until you release your finger from the chart.</p>

<p><a name="trackOff"></a><em><strong>* How can I permanently remove the Track line?</strong></em><br />
Press your device's Options key, then press the Preferences button in the Menu, then click the checkbox for Enter Simulation Mode. You'd of course repeat this process to turn the line back on, and resume GPS navigation. Another way to remove the Track line is to turn off GPS, but the internal GPS on many devices might have difficulty re-acquiring your location while in flight.</p><BR />


<p><a name="battGPS"></a><em><strong>* Can battery level affect my device's internal GPS?</strong></em><br />
Yes. Users have reported that their GPS may not acquire as quickly or reliably at low battery levels (below 30% or even higher on some devices). Plugging your device into external power may help with your device's internal GPS performance.</p>

<p><a name="dispLong"></a> <em><strong>* How can I get Destination or Base charts to display longer?</strong></em><br />
When GPS is active, the chart display will briefly shift to your Destination airport just after you input. You can switch to Simulation Mode in Preferences (press Option key, Preferences button, then Enter Simulation Mode). Simulation Mode will let you jump instantly to any airport for both display and A/FD info for that airport, while retaining GPS operation. To view or use your current location again, just un-check the Simulation Mode checkbox.</p>

<p><a name="launchTime"></a> <em><strong>* How long does it take from Avare launch before I see charts?</strong></em><br />
The startup time depends mostly on your device, but usually a few seconds up to a minute. Note that no charts or Airport Diagrams can be displayed until you Download them. If you see a black screen, chances are your GPS isn't working yet or you haven't downloaded the chart for your area.</p>

<p><a name="noCell"></a> <em><strong>* Can I use Avare without cell or data service?</strong></em><br />
Yes, once you have used Download to install any charts (or the set of Airport Diagrams) as desired, all features of Avare work just fine in airplane mode on every Android device we've tested. Note that the internal GPS on some devices may have difficulty acquiring "lock" without cell and/or data/wifi, but will work fine in airplane mode once lock is acquired IF the device is kept awake and you don't switch out of the Avare app.</p><BR />


<p><a name="dBase"></a> <em><strong>* What's in the Database file Avare uses?</strong></em><br />
The file named Database in the Downloads menu contains the current A/FD (except for Airport Diagrams) and is also required for Avare to know the name, boundaries and GPS calibration for each chart. Before you can use any charts, Avare needs this information so that it can assemble all the charts you've downloaded into a seamless mosaic. Avare then calculates where to display your GPS location on that mosaic of downloaded charts. Always be sure to Download the latest Database <span style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span> you Download any new or updated charts. Note that if an item in the Download list has a green checkmark at the left, it's current and will ignore any attempt to update it.</p>

<p><a name="browse"></a> <em><strong>* How do I browse charts and then get back to current location?</strong></em><br />
You can browse charts by zooming and dragging them, and double-tap to resume GPS moving map. To browse freely, use Simulation Mode, and then turn off that mode to instantly return to your current location. In Map view press your device's Option key, the Preferences button, then check-mark the Enter Simulation Mode line. To view or use your current location again, just un-check the Enter Simulation Mode checkbox.</p>
